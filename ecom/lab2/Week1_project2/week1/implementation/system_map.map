Design Summary
--------------

Design Summary:
Number of errors:      0
Number of warnings:    2
Logic Utilization:
  Number of Slice Flip Flops:         1,020 out of  15,360    6%
  Number of 4 input LUTs:             2,118 out of  15,360   13%
Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:          1,408 out of   7,680   18%
    Number of Slices containing only related logic:   1,408 out of   1,408 100%
    Number of Slices containing unrelated logic:          0 out of   1,408   0%
      *See NOTES below for an explanation of the effects of unrelated logic.
  Total Number of 4 input LUTs:       2,173 out of  15,360   14%
    Number used as logic:             1,743
    Number used as a route-thru:         55
    Number used for Dual Port RAMs:     256
      (Two LUTs used per Dual Port RAM)
    Number used as Shift registers:     119

  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.

  Number of bonded IOBs:                 10 out of     173    5%
    IOB Flip Flops:                       8
